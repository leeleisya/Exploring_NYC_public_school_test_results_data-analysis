# exploring_NYC_public_schools-data-analysis
Using data manipulation to explore and analyse the statistics of test scores in public schools in New York.
This quick project is mainly focused on training to sort and subset data, rounding values and group summary statistics.

The goal was to analyse data to answer on these questions:
- Which NYC schools have the best math results?
- What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?
- Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?
